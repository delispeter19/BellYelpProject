Goal: Remake Yelp using Yelp Fusion API

Design:
MVP Design Pattern + Network Handler

General Use:
To see businesses, simply search the name, location or type of 
cuisine you are looking for, then select the items in the list 
to see more details such as name, photo, hours, ratings, etc...

For Developers:
To use the Fusion API, you need to pass a dictionary of Yelp
Fusion search types and their values to the ViewPresenter's 
methods.
